# 12.Deep_learning_Examples

- This repository showcases the results of several experiments with different Deep Learning techniques. First, in the
context of gender recognition by voice and speech analysis, the
performance of a Decision Tree learning machine is assessed
in two scenarios (original feature space vs. reduced dimensions
by means of an autoencoder). As expected, the original 20-
dimensional dataset rendered finer metrics than the condensed
version. Second, the training outcomes of a LeNet5 architecture
for the MNIST hand-written digit dataset unveiled stellar results
for a modest number of epochs. Finally, with the intention of
getting familiar with GANsâ€™ architecture, two additional fieldtests were carried out: a lightweight GAN for the MNIST dataset
and a StyleGAN for generating human faces and fast photo
animation.
